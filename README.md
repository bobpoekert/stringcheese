# stringcheese

Stringcheese is a string template library for clojure. Libraries like Hiccup are excellent when you want to generate standard HTML from scratch, but sometimes you need to do something cheesy. Maybe you got a blob of HTML from a WYSIWYG tool that you need to templatize. Maybe the HTML you want to geneate needs to have things in it that aren't quite HTML (like edge-side-include tags). Maybe you're generating somehting that isn't HTML at all (like nginx configuration files). In these cases and many more, Stringcheese can help.
